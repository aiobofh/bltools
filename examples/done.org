* DONE 05 It shall be possible to toggle stories to DONE to track progress
  SCHEDULED: <2017-01-03> DEADLINE: <2017-01-05>

  As a product owner I need to be able to track story progress and to be
  able to calculate velocity over time.

  * The SCHEDULED Emacs Org-Mode tag is the date when the story was started.
  * The DEADLINE Emacs Org-Mode tag is the date when the story was done.

  This is actually MANDATORY to be able to consider a story to be done.

* DONE 06 Another story to place in second sprint to verify blvelocity
  SCHEDULED: <2017-01-09> DEADLINE: <2017-01-10>

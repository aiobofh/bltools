* TODO 01-20 It shall be possible to make fuzzy estimate ranges of a story

  As a product owner I want to be able to keep stories estimated even if
  they are not well defined yet.

  As a product owner I need to be able to have single (and accurate)
  estimates of stories in the backlog as the stories grow more defined.
